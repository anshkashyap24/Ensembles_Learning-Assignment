        "1.  Can we use Bagging for regression problems ?\n",
        " - Yes, Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) can definitely be used for regression problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the difference between multiple model training and single model training ?\n",
        " - Single model training refers to the process of training one machine learning model on the entire training dataset to learn patterns and make predictions.\n",
        " The model is trained using a single algorithm (e.g., Decision Tree, Linear Regression, SVM), and its performance depends solely on how well this one model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Multiple model training, also known as ensemble learning, refers to the process of training multiple models—either of the same type (homogeneous) or different types (heterogeneous)—and combining their predictions to improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization.\n",
        "Common techniques include Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking, where the final prediction is made by averaging, voting, or using a meta-model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Explain the concept of feature randomness in Random Forest.\n",
        " - Feature randomness means that at each split in a tree, only a random subset of features is considered. This increases diversity among trees in the forest, reduces correlation between them, and improves overall model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is OOB (Out-of-Bag) Score?\n",
        " - OOB score is an internal validation method in Bagging and Random Forest. Since each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample, about one-third of the data is left out. These \"out-of-bag\" samples are used to estimate the model’s accuracy without needing a separate validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How can you measure the importance of features in a Random Forest model?\n",
        " - Feature importance is measured by how much a feature decreases impurity (e.g., Gini or MSE) across all trees. Features contributing more to splitting nodes and reducing error are considered more important.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the working principle of a Bagging Classifier.\n",
        " - Bagging Classifier trains multiple base classifiers on different random subsets (with replacement) of the data. Final prediction is made by majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression). It reduces overfitting by combining diverse models.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How do you evaluate a Bagging Classifier’s performance?\n",
        " - Performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, depending on the problem. OOB score or cross-validation can also be used to assess generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How does a Bagging Regressor work?\n",
        " - Bagging Regressor trains multiple base regressors (like Decision Trees) on bootstrapped subsets. The final prediction is the average of predictions from all models. This ensemble approach reduces variance and improves robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the main advantage of ensemble techniques?\n",
        " - The main advantage is improved accuracy and robustness. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to reduce overfitting, handle noise, and generalize better to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the main challenge of ensemble methods?\n",
        " - The main challenges include increased complexity, longer training time, and reduced interpretability. Managing and tuning multiple models is computationally more expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Explain the key idea behind ensemble techniques.\n",
        " - The key idea is to combine multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random) to form a strong learner with high predictive power. Aggregation reduces errors like bias and variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is a Random Forest Classifier?\n",
        " - It is an ensemble classifier that builds multiple decision trees using bagging and feature randomness. Final prediction is made using majority voting. It reduces overfitting and increases prediction accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What are the main types of ensemble techniques?\n",
        " - Bagging - Random Forest\n",
        "\n",
        " - Boosting -  AdaBoost, XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        " - Stacking - Combines predictions using a meta-learner\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is ensemble learning in machine learning?\n",
        " - Ensemble learning is a technique where multiple models are combined to solve a problem. The goal is to produce a stronger and more accurate model than any individual one.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. When should we avoid using ensemble methods?\n",
        " - Avoid when:\n",
        "\n",
        "    The base model already performs well.\n",
        "\n",
        "    You need high interpretability.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Resources are limited (ensembles are computationally heavy).\n",
        "\n",
        "    The dataset is small, and ensemble may overfit.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. How does Bagging help in reducing overfitting?\n",
        " - Bagging reduces overfitting by training models on different subsets of data and combining their predictions. This smooths out model errors and reduces variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Why is Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree?\n",
        " - Random Forest reduces overfitting, improves accuracy, and handles noise better by averaging multiple trees trained with different data and features. A single decision tree is more prone to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the role of bootstrap sampling in Bagging?\n",
        " - Bootstrap sampling creates random datasets with replacement from the original dataset. Each model in the ensemble is trained on a different sample, which increases diversity and reduces variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  What are some real-world applications of ensemble techniques ?\n",
        " - Credit scoring\n",
        " - Fraud detection\n",
        " - Medical diagnosis\n",
        " - Spam filtering\n",
        " - Recommendation systems\n",
        " - Stock market prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "20.\n",
        " - Bagging is an ensemble learning technique that trains multiple models independently on different random subsets of the training data (with replacement) and then combines their predictions by voting (classification) or averaging (regression)\n",
        "Its main goal is to reduce variance and improve model stability.\n",
        " - Boosting is an ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, where each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous ones.\n",
        "The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of all models, usually using weighted voting or averaging.\n",
        "Boosting mainly aims to reduce bias and improve accuracy."
